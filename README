NGS_Process_build (NGS流程构建)

Download the demo file(demo.tar.gz) from http://172.16.98.98.cqu.pt/xinqi
If you have any question,  contact with 2016212287@stu.cqupt.edu.cn

Follow the next orders with a straightforward experience of NGS.
cd NGS_Process_Build.tar.gz
cd sample_backup
sh decompression.sh
cd ..
vim export_path.txt
sh NGS_Process_Build.sh 


NGS_Process_Build.sh is a one-key script to carry out our task.
	for instance:
	sh NGS_Process_Build.sh 

Insturctions

1.During the process, the yeast(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was chosen as the NGS experiment object.

2.The prepared files are below the directory, which includes the your_object.fasta and your_object.gff and your_object.sra that can be transformed to your_object.fastq, and all of them can be downloaded from NCBI.

Procedures

1.Download tools or applets from the Websites such as  bowtie2, NCBI etc.
These tools are highly recommended:
	bowtie2
	sratoolkit
	tophat
	cufflinks
All of them can be easily obtained from official websites.
Needless to say, They will be provided in the directory.

2.Download the species you would like to run NGS from NCBI.
What we demonstrate is the Yeast(baker's yeast) on account of its size.
These files are basically needed:
	your_object.fasta(genome files)
	your_object.gtf(genome annotation files)
	your_object.ras(It can be converted into fastq format)

3.Preparation 
Add orders to environment.
	For instance:
		export PATH=$PATH:~/NGS_Process_building/sratoolkit.2.9.6-1-centos_linux64/bin
		export PATH=$PATH:~/tophat_file/tophat-2.0.13.Linux_x86_64
		etc.
	pay attention to the location of your files.
	write these instances into your ~/.bashrc in cast orders' 'disappear'

4.Constitute your_object index
	for instance:
		bowtie2-build GCF_000146045.2_R64_genomic.fna Yeast
You will get *.bt2 format file.

5.tophat for producing sam format file
	for instance:
		fasterq-dump *.ras
		tophat -p8 -G GCF_000146045.2_R64_genomic.gff -T ./Yeast ./SRR9043513.sra_1.fastq ./SRR9043513.sra_2.fastq 
You will get bam format file.

6.cufflinks for merging
	for instance:
		cufflinks tophat_out/accepted_hits.bam 
You will get standard output files like genes.fpkm_tracking and isoforms.fpkm_tracking etc.
